HOW TO USE
1. Using Audacity (https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/), convert .mp3 files to .wav.
    Open file in Audacity
    Click “File” menu
    Click “Save other”
    Click “Export as Wav”
    Export it with default setting
2. Move .wav file to the speech-to-text/source directory.
3. Steps 1 and 2 can be repeated for multiple .mp3 files.  (Or use chains to process multiple files at once: https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/chains_for_batch_processing_and_effects_automation.html)
4. Open Terminal.
5. In Terminal, navigate to the speech-to-text directory.  Example:
    cd "/Users/kfong25/Documents/05Projects/Code/Python/speech-to-text"
6a. Run the fast.py script against the source directory.  Example:
    python3 fast.py "/Users/kfong25/Documents/05Projects/Code/Python/speech-to-text/source"
6b. OR run the fast.py script against a .wav file in the source directory.  Example:
    python3 fast.py "/Users/kfong25/Documents/05Projects/Code/Python/speech-to-text/source/winston-churchill-the-threat-of-germany.wav"
